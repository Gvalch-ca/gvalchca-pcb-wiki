This folder contains some useful files for your project.

### traymount-template.dxf
Download this file and use it together with the output of ai03's plate generator. What you need to do is:
1. Open both files in your CAD software;
2. Place a dot in the center of the Escape cutout of ai03's generator output;
3. Copy all switch cutouts from ai03's generator output and paste them into template file;
4. With 'Move point to point' function, move the switch coutouts so the dot in the center of the Escape cutout matches the dot on the template;
5. Delete the dots in the middle of the Escape cutout (there will be 2 in the exact same place, delete both);
6. Save the result as .dxf and send it to your cutting service. Enjoy!

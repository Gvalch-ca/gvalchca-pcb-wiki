# GA15.0

This is the release version of GA15.0
List of main features:
* Supported switches: Alps SKCL/SKCM and compatible
* Supported layouts: as shown below
* Form factor: standard 60%. Fits in most traymount cases (like TOFU, Fjell, etc.) and in some 60% keyboards (f.e. Prophet, HEX.3C, Thermal, S58, and lots more)
* Firmware: QMK and VIA
* Connection: USB Type C or JST w/ ai03 Unified Daughterboard
* Hardware: fully soldered from factory, QC'd and flashed by me. All you'll need to do is solder your switches.
* Unique features:
    - mounting cuts for Unikorn-style mounting
    - two horizontal flex cuts similar to wilba.tech WT60-D to provide flexy typing experience with softer plates
    - huge layout support, but without too many options, so PCB isnt the mess of holes
    - PCB-mount Cherry stabilizers support for all keys produced by SP (DCS and DSA)
    - Next-Gen routing and schematic standards. Beautiful look
